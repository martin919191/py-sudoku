# pySudoku

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with many Python functions implemented to solve a Sudoku matrix. Code implements mainly two different approaches: One iterative for "easy" matrices, one iterative when things gets complicated.

Most functions contain a description of what they do, and how to use them (idea is to have them all described soon). No special modules are required, only `random` and `copy` modules are required.

No optimization has yet been tried, so code is at its initial version, meaning it can be improved in many ways.
